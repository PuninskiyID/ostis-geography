<p>Obviously, if you need to add more information about the object, the only solution would be duplication. In other words you will have to create one more node with the identifier the Moon and to connect new properties of sc.g-couples with it. The solution of this task is to increase the contact area of node. A new element is introduced for it. This is sc.g-tire. You can see an example of the same sc.g-text written using the second SCg-code extension on the image</p>
