<p>Full development of this method is the purpose of a separate project. Now for a more detailed consideration of the syntax SC-code we need a minimum, but semantically complete tools SCg-code that provides an image of any sc-designs. We call such basic means of a SCg-code a SCg-code core (SCg-core). The basic properties of the SCg-core are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>each information design, owned by the SCg-core, is isomorphic to the sc-design which it plots. In this sense means of a SCg-core are closest to a SC-code.</li>
    <li> synonymy elements is forbidden in sc-designs and designs belonging SCg-core. SCg-core design  convenient to illustrate the syntactic and semantic properties of SC-code,but aren't convenient for wide practical use as language of visualization sc-structures, because are not visible. Development of the SCg-code aimed at the resolution of this contradiction (see a SCg-code ).</li>
</ul>
