Task of the 
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent_of_scp_operator_interpretation">sc-agent of scp-operator interpretation</sc_element></b> is interpretation of the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program's</sc_element>operators, that is execution in
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> actions,which described by the specific  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element>. This 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agent</sc_element> is activated in case of appearance in  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_memory">sc-memory</sc_element> of the
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp- operator</sc_element>, inhering to the class  of the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "active_sc_agent">active sc-operators</sc_element>. After execution of the actions are described with
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element>, 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element> is added in a set of 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "executed_scp_operator">executed scp-operator</sc_element>. In a case, when semantics of action, described by the
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element>, suggests the possibility of branching of an
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element> after executing this 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp- operator</sc_element>,then use one of the subsets of the class 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "executed_scp_operator">executed scp-operators</sc_element> â€“ 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "unsuccessfully_executed_scp_operator">unsuccessfully executed scp-operator</sc_element> or 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "successfully_executed_scp_operator">successfully executed scp-operator</sc_element>.
