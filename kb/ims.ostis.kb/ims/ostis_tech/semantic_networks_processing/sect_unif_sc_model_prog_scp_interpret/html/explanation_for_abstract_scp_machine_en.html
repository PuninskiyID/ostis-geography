All
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "abstract_scp_machine">abstract scp-machine</sc_element></b>
is regarded as an holistic <sc_element sys_idtf  = "abstract_sc_agent">abstract sc-agent</sc_element>,
which may have several options decomposition, one of which is taken as a reference and is described in this section.
In this case, one of the possible variants, though not the most appropriate, is the variant of realization of all 
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "abstract_scp_machine">abstract scp-machine</sc_element></b> 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "atomic_abstract_sc_agent">as a single atomic abstract sc-agent</sc_element>.
