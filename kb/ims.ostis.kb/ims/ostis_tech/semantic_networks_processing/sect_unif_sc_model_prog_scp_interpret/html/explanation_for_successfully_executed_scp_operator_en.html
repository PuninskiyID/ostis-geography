In a set of the
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "successfully_executed_scp_operator">successfully executed scp-operators</sc_element></b> get those 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "executed_scp_operator">executed scp-operators</sc_element>, in the process of which execution some additional condition was satisfied, depending on the particular class of operator (for example, attempt of search of the given construction was successful). In this case,turning to the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operators</sc_element>will be implemented,  connected with this by means of a linking of the relation
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_then">next operator in case of successful execution*</sc_element></b>.
