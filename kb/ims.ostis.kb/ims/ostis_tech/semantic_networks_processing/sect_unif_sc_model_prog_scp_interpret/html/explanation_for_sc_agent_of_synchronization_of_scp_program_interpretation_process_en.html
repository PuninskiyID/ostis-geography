The task of the
<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent_of_synchronization_of_scp_program_interpretation_process">sc-agent of synchronization of scp-program interpretation process</sc_element></b> is supporting of transitions between 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operators</sc_element> within one 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_program">scp-program</sc_element>. This 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_agent">sc-agent</sc_element> is activated when adding some  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operators</sc_element> in the set of executed
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element>. Transition to
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_arc">sc-arc</sc_element>is carried further, belonging to the relation of the
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_goto">goto scp-operator*</sc_element> (or  more private relations, in case, if 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element> was added in the set of 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "successfully_executed_scp_operator">successfully executed scp-operators</sc_element> or 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "unsuccessfully_executed_scp_operator">unsuccessfully executed scp-operators</sc_element>). Thus next
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operator</sc_element> becomes 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "active_scp_operator">active scp-operator</sc_element> only if all
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operators</sc_element>, which is related entering  
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_arc">sc-arcs</sc_element>, inherings to the relation
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_goto">goto scp-oprator*</sc_element> (or  more private relations) became set members
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "executed_scp_operator">executed_scp-operators</sc_element> (or, respectively, its subsets). Otherwise there is a waiting of completion of required 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "scp_operator">scp-operators</sc_element>.
